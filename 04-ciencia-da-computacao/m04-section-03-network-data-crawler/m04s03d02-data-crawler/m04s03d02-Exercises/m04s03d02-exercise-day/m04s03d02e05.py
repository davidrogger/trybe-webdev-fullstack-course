# NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLDâS GREAT THINKERSâA MARVELOUSLY
# CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFEÂ
# When and howdid the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there
# something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality?
# Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the
# existenceof beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent
# âgrand designâor does science offer another explanation? The most
# fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of
# lifeitself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the
# territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meetâif
# only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and LeonardMlodinow
# present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of
# the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance
# and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explainthat according to
# quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence
# or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe
# exists simultaneously. When applied tothe universe as a whole, this
# idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But
# the âtop-downâmultiverseâthe idea that ours is just one of many
# universes that appearedspontaneously out of nothing, each with
# different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question
# the conventional concept of reality, posing a âmodel-dependentâtheory
# ofeverything.âand provokeâlike no other.
